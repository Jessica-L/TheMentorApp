<h1>About Us</h1>
  <h2>
      <a href="http://railstutorial.org/">Mentor Link</a> is an app for Computer Science 
      enthusiasts and beginner programmers. 
  </h2>

  
     <h2>
      Users will be able to seek guidance about computer science 
      related topics from mentors (college students, teachers/professors and industry professionals in 
      the field) as well as each other in a controlled, friendly online environment. The app will also 
      serve as an opportunity for industry professionals, teachers and Computer Science students to 
      “pay it forward” and volunteer their time and expertise to help others. In the future, we aim to 
      customize this service to middle schoolers and highschoolers in hopes our service will help 
      bridge the gap in comprehension between middle school and the college-level expectations of a 
      computer science degree program.
