# Mentor Link
An app for connecting Computer Science enthusiasts and beginner programmers with their peers and trusted mentors
--------------
Created by: Noah Dillon, Andrew Gordon and Jessica Lynch

Users will be able to seek guidance about computer science related topics from mentors (college students, teachers/professors and industry professionals in the field) as well as each other in a controlled, friendly online environment. The app will also serve as an opportunity for industry professionals, teachers and Computer Science students to “pay it forward” and volunteer their time and expertise to help others. In the future, we aim to customize this service to middle schoolers and highschoolers in hopes our service will help bridge the gap in comprehension between middle school and the college-level expectations of a computer science degree program.
